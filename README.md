-------What Project Does--------- 

It got 2 models user and admin

Only one admin is there. 
while there can be multiple users

User and admin have to login first

New user will first signup 
and then login to move inside application
There a user can either fill an ongoing survey request or create its own new survey.
We have impplemented a functionality of virtual currency.
Virtual currency is used here to provide survey filling reward which can be then used to create a new survey

Filling a survey will reward you an amount.
Conducting a survey will charge you amount.

The amount of reward and charge will depend on the number of questions and other factors. One user can fill one survey only one time.

In a new survey , four different type of questions can be created.
